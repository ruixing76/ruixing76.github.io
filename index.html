<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">The University of Melbourne NLP Group</a>, developing computational methods for explaining modelâ€™s decision that involves complex reasoning process (i.e., fact-checking) in natural language. During my PhD journey, I worked on topics largely concerning Misinformation and Automated Fact-Checking Systems, I have also worked on Machine-Generated-Text and LLM Uncertainty.</p> <p>My long term vision includes: 1) investigating how models acquire and utilize parametric and non-parametric knowledge in complex decision-making scenarios, examining their links to human cognition, memory, and hallucination behavior and 2) developing efficient and collaborative strategies that integrate Large Language Models (LLM) with Smaller Language Models (SLM).</p> <p>I am jointly advised by <a href="https://jeyhan.my/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Dr.Jey Han Lau</a> and <a href="https://eltimster.github.io/www/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Prof. Tim Baldwin</a>.
