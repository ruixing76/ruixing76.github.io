Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing" target="_blank">The University of Melbourne NLP Group</a>, happily working with <a href="https://jeyhan.my/" target="_blank">Dr.Jey Han Lau</a> and <a href="https://eltimster.github.io/www/" target="_blank">Prof. Tim Baldwin</a>. Currently I am visiting <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/">MBZUAI NLP department</a>, hosted by <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/">Prof. Preslav Nakov</a>.

I have broad research interests in Natural Language Processing. Currently working on explainable fact checking, justification/explanation generation and affective information in the diffusion of misinformation.
