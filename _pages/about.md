I am currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing" target="_blank">The University of Melbourne NLP Group</a>, developing computational methods for explaining model's decision that involves complex reasoning process (i.e., fact-checking) in natural language. During my PhD journey, I worked on topics largely concerning Misinformation and Automated Fact-Checking Systems, I have also worked on Machine-Generated-Text and LLM Uncertainty. 

My long term vision includes: 1) investigating how models acquire and utilize parametric and non-parametric knowledge in complex decision-making scenarios, examining their links to human cognition, memory, and hallucination behavior and 2) developing efficient and collaborative strategies that integrate Large Language Models (LLM) with Smaller Language Models (SLM).

I am jointly advised by <a href="https://jeyhan.my/" target="_blank">Dr.Jey Han Lau</a> and <a href="https://eltimster.github.io/www/" target="_blank">Prof. Tim Baldwin</a>. In 2024, I was a visiting student researcher at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/">MBZUAI NLP department</a>, hosted by <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/">Prof. Preslav Nakov</a>.
